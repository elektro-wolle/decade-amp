# Selectable Decade Amplifier

![Front](pcb-front-assembled.jpg)

Due to my - in the highest sensitive ranges - a little bit noisy Rigol DS-1054z scope, I decided to provide a small pre-amplifier for low-voltage measurements (a.k.a. electret microphone signals, shunt-voltages, etc.).
For best performance in the micro-volt range, a dual stage amplifier (both stages provide 10V/1V gain) is built with the [MCP6V27](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP6V27). A third and last stage gives the final 10V/1V amplification resulting in a gain of 1000V/1V with a 3db cut-off at ~200 kHz.

For the third stage and the virtual ground a cheaper [MCP6292](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP6292) is used.

**The input voltage must not exceed Â±1.5V!**

Current consumption should be ~1.6mA, the CR2032 coin-cell should last about 200h. The slide-switch disables the op-amps, if 1V/1V is selected.

Further improvements:
*  TVS-Diodes for clamping input voltage?
